Script in Matlab and Python that quantifies the buoyancy potential energy required for a water parcel in hydrostatic equilibrium to be vertically displaced from a specific reference height. Input data and a demonstration for reproducing the figures in the manuscript are included.

## Demo
To view the demostration, go to the notebook `demo/demo.ipynb` and run it.

## Data acknowledgment
- The Gulf of Mexico data used were obtained from the GOMEX-4 (GOM-04) oceanographic campaign, conducted from November 2 to November 20 aboard the Research Vessel Riviera Maya (NAVIYUC), as part of the CIGoM Project ([https://cigom.org/](https://cigom.org/)).
- Antarctica data were downloaded from [https://slocum-data.marine.rutgers.edu](http://slocum-data.marine.rutgers.edu/erddap/search/advanced.html?page=1&itemsPerPage=1000&searchFor=rutgers&protocol=%28ANY%29&cdm_data_type=%28ANY%29&institution=%28ANY%29&ioos_category=%28ANY%29&keywords=%28ANY%29&long_name=%28ANY%29&standard_name=%28ANY%29&variableName=%28ANY%29&maxLat=-58&minLon=-178&maxLon=359&minLat=-84&minTime=&maxTime=).
